CSCI 3340 | The final project that we worked on as a group for our Software Engineering 1 course in which we implemented an Agile working environment in order to fix the program that was provided to us in Ruby. The program was of a gradebook that has a teacher login and a teacher's assistant login that they both can access the grades and edit them. The initial code that was given had many errors with what the professor wanted, so we used test driven developement and other skills that we learned in this course to implement fixes to these errors and document all the work we collectively have done. We split the work amoungst the four of us in the group and rotated the roles fairly to allow everyone a chance at handling various positions such as: bug searcher, bug fixer, and tester. I took on all of these self-given roles in order to gain the true experience of working in an Agile enviroment. This program can be run in Codespaces on GitHub or other IDEs that support Ruby.
